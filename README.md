# 🪐 Matte Gyroscope 3D Asset

A highly interactive, standalone 3D portfolio asset featuring a matte-finish planet, gyroscopic rings, and immersive space effects. Built with **React** and **Three.js** in a single, portable HTML file.

> **Live Demo:** https://j-abid.github.io/Customized-Saturn-Gyroscope/

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Visuals & Aesthetics

  * **Matte Planet Core:** A non-glowing, high-roughness planetary surface for a sleek, modern look.
  * **Triple Gyroscopic Rings:** Three independently rotating rings with dynamic thickness and individual color controls.
  * **Cyberpunk UI:** A glassmorphism settings panel with tabbed navigation and neon accents.
  * **Fluid Cursor:** A custom "foggy" fluid cursor trail that reacts to mouse movement.

### 🎮 Interaction & Physics

  * **Momentum-Based Rotation:** Drag the planet to spin it. The physics engine includes friction and momentum for a realistic feel.
  * **Editable Typography:** Click directly on the Title and Subtitle to edit the text in real-time.
  * **Dynamic Re-rendering:** Adjusting ring thickness or geometry instantly rebuilds the 3D meshes without refreshing.

### 🌌 Atmosphere & Effects

  * **Toggleable Space Elements:**
      * **Star Field:** Parallax background stars.
      * **Asteroid Belt:** Rotating particle belt.
      * **Data Streams:** Matrix-style "shooting stars" passing through the scene.

## ⚙️ Customization (No Code Required)

Includes a built-in **Settings Panel** accessible via the gear icon. You can tweak the entire look in real-time:

| Tab | Controls |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CORE** | Planet Color, Rotation Speed (Physics) |
| **RINGS** | Individual Colors (Ring 1, 2, 3), Ring Thickness |
| **SPACE** | Toggle Stars, Asteroids, Data Streams |
| **FX** | Cursor Fog Color, Size, and Density |
